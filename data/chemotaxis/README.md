# Chemotaxis Validation Data

This directory contains published C. elegans chemotaxis data for validating simulated agent behavior against real biological observations.

## Files

- `literature_ci_values.json` - Published chemotaxis index (CI) values from peer-reviewed literature

## Chemotaxis Index (CI)

The chemotaxis index is the standard metric in C. elegans research for quantifying attraction/avoidance behavior:

```text
CI = (N_attractant - N_control) / N_total
```

Where:

- **N_attractant** = steps/time spent in the attractant zone (near food/chemical)
- **N_control** = steps/time spent in the control zone (away from attractant)
- **N_total** = total episode steps/time

### Interpretation

| CI Value | Interpretation |
|----------|----------------|
| +1.0 | Perfect attraction (always at food) |
| +0.75 | Excellent attraction (wild-type level) |
| +0.6 | Good attraction (target for simulation) |
| +0.4 | Weak attraction (minimum biological match) |
| 0.0 | No preference (random movement) |
| -1.0 | Perfect avoidance |

## Usage

The validation module (`elegans.validation`) uses this data to:

1. Calculate chemotaxis metrics from simulated trajectories
2. Compare agent CI against biological ranges
3. Report validation level (none/minimum/target/excellent)

### Example

```python
from elegans.validation import (
    calculate_chemotaxis_metrics,
    ChemotaxisValidationBenchmark,
)

# Calculate metrics from trajectory
metrics = calculate_chemotaxis_metrics(
    positions=agent_positions,
    food_positions=food_locations,
    attractant_zone_radius=5.0,
)

# Validate against literature
benchmark = ChemotaxisValidationBenchmark()
result = benchmark.validate_agent(metrics)

print(f"Agent CI: {result.agent_ci:.2f}")
print(f"Biological range: {result.biological_ci_range}")
print(f"Matches biology: {result.matches_biology}")
print(f"Validation level: {result.validation_level.value}")
```

## Validation Thresholds

| Level | CI Threshold | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| None | < 0.4 | Not biologically plausible |
| Minimum | >= 0.4 | Minimally plausible |
| Target | >= 0.6 | Good biological match |
| Excellent | >= 0.75 | Wild-type level performance |

## Future Work: Improving Biological Fidelity

Current RL agents (PPO, MLP) achieve high task success rates (>90%) but stabilize around CI 0.43-0.47, below the biological range (0.50-0.85). This is expected since agents optimize for task completion, not biological fidelity. Real C. elegans have evolved chemotaxis circuits that maximize time near food gradients without a discrete "goal" concept.

Potential approaches to improve biological fidelity:

1. **Reward shaping**: Add explicit reward for time spent in attractant zones to encourage gradient-following behavior
2. **Curriculum learning**: Pre-train on gradient-following tasks before foraging to establish biologically-plausible navigation primitives
3. **Architecture changes**: Add sensory processing layers that mimic C. elegans neural circuits (e.g., AWC/AWA sensory neuron topology)
4. **Biased random walk**: Implement the pirouette-based navigation strategy described in Pierce-Shimomura et al. (1999)
5. **Alternative metrics**: Explore whether path curvature or run-length distributions better capture agent navigation strategies

These approaches could be explored in future phases focusing on biological plausibility rather than task performance alone.
