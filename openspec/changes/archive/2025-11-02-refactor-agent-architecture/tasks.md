______________________________________________________________________

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 24 tasks across 6 phases
**Completed Tasks**: 19 tasks fully complete, 3 tasks partially complete, 2 tasks not started (not required)
**Actual Effort**: ~3 days of implementation
**Architecture Achieved**: Episode delegation complete with pragmatic component usage
**Test Results**: 409 tests passing, 70.77% coverage (exceeds 70% goal)
**Code Quality**: 0 pyright errors, 0 ruff errors
**LOC Reduction**: ~450 lines (run_episode: 268→8 lines, run_manyworlds_mode: 192→4 lines)

**Pragmatic Architecture Decisions**:

- ✅ Episode execution delegated to StandardEpisodeRunner and ManyworldsEpisodeRunner
- ✅ Active components: SatietyManager, FoodConsumptionHandler, RewardCalculator, MetricsTracker
- ✅ Simplified runner interface: No-arg constructors, direct agent component access
- ❌ StepProcessor: Implemented but not integrated (21-28 hour effort, diminishing returns)
- ❌ EpisodeRenderer: Class exists but rendering kept inline (simpler, works well)
- ❌ EpisodeResult: Removed as unnecessary (runners return list[tuple] for compatibility)

**Key Benefits Achieved**:

1. Clean separation of concerns (agent manages state, runners orchestrate episodes)
2. Reduced complexity in main agent class (run_episode and run_manyworlds_mode drastically simplified)
3. Improved testability (integration tests with real components)
4. Maintained backward compatibility (all existing tests pass)
5. Production-ready code (clean static analysis, good coverage)
