# 003: Spiking Brain Optimization

**Status**: `completed`

**Branch**: `feature/18-improve-spiking-brain`

**Date Started**: 2025-12-19

**Date Completed**: 2025-12-22

## Objective

Develop a fully functional spiking neural network brain using biologically realistic LIF (Leaky Integrate-and-Fire) neurons with surrogate gradient descent, achieving competitive performance with classical approaches on navigation tasks.

## Background

The quantum nematode project previously explored quantum circuits and classical MLPs. Spiking neural networks offer:

- **Biological realism**: Models actual neuron dynamics with membrane potentials and spike trains
- **Temporal processing**: 100 timestep integration captures temporal dependencies
- **Energy efficiency**: Event-driven computation (though not exploited in simulation)
- **Novel learning**: Surrogate gradients bridge non-differentiable spiking with gradient descent

Initial implementation used STDP (Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity), which was limited. This experiment rebuilds the spiking brain from scratch using modern surrogate gradient methods.

## Hypothesis

A spiking brain using:

1. LIF neuron dynamics with proper temporal integration
2. Surrogate gradient descent for backpropagation through spikes
3. REINFORCE policy gradients for reinforcement learning
4. Adaptive learning rate and entropy decay schedules

...should achieve 70-85% success rate on static navigation tasks, competitive with classical MLP (85-92%).

## Method

### Architecture

**Network**: 2-layer spiking neural network

- Input: 2 dimensions (gradient strength, relative angle)
- Hidden: 128-256 LIF neurons × 2 layers
- Output: 4 actions (FORWARD, LEFT, RIGHT, STAY)
- Timesteps: 100 (temporal integration)

**LIF Neuron Dynamics**:

```text
v[t+1] = v[t] + (1/τ_m) * (v_rest - v[t]) + I[t]
spike[t] = 1 if v[t] > v_threshold else 0
v[t] = v_reset if spike[t] else v[t]
```

Parameters: `τ_m=20.0`, `v_threshold=1.0`, `v_reset=0.0`, `v_rest=0.0`

**Surrogate Gradient**: Sigmoid approximation for differentiable backpropagation through spikes.

**Learning**: REINFORCE policy gradient with advantage normalization, baseline averaging, and entropy regularization.

### Code Changes

- `elegans/brain/arch/spiking.py` - Complete rewrite with surrogate gradients
- `elegans/brain/arch/_spiking_layers.py` - LIF neurons, surrogate gradients
- Config files: Added decay parameters and population coding options

### Configuration

See [Appendix: Hyperparameter Reference](supporting/003/experiment-details.md#hyperparameter-reference) for complete configuration details.

## Results

### Summary Table

| Environment | Spiking Best | MLP Baseline | Quantum | Gap to MLP |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|---------|------------|
| Static Navigation | 100% | 100% | 100% | 0% |
| Dynamic Foraging | 100% | 100% | 100% | 0% |
| **Predator + Foraging** | **63%** | **92%** | 95% | **29%** |

### Detailed Findings

#### Static Navigation

Achieved **100% success rate** with composite score 0.932 (vs MLP's 0.960). Best session showed perfect 66/66 runs post-convergence.

Key milestones:

- **Phase 1-2**: Fixed gradient explosion (surrogate_alpha: 10.0 → 1.0)
- **Phase 3**: Added LR decay (0.015/episode) and entropy decay (0.15 → 0.01 over 50 episodes)
- **Phase 5**: Kaiming initialization reduced variance from 60-point spread to 10-point spread

#### Dynamic Foraging

Achieved **100% success rate** with composite score 0.733 (vs MLP's 0.822).

Key breakthrough: **Intra-episode updates** (every 10 steps instead of episode-end only) enabled learning in sparse-reward environments. Lower learning rate (0.0001 vs 0.001) required for the larger 136k-parameter network.

#### Predator Environment

Achieved **63% success rate** with composite score 0.556 (vs MLP's 0.740).

Key breakthrough: **Slower LR decay** (0.01 → 0.005) more than doubled success rate from 28% to 63%. The original decay rate was too aggressive, causing the learning rate to bottom out before the network fully learned the task.

## Analysis

### Why Spiking Works Now

1. **Surrogate gradients enable learning**: Differentiable approximation of non-differentiable spikes
2. **Temporal integration helps**: 100 timesteps capture state dynamics
3. **Proper gradient management**: Value + norm clipping prevents explosion
4. **Decay schedules critical**: LR and entropy decay enable explore→exploit transition
5. **Intra-episode updates essential**: Dense learning signals for complex tasks

### Why Variance Still Exists

Even with optimal hyperparameters, ~1 in 4 sessions succeed on predator tasks. This is inherent to:

- Random weight initialization (some starts in better parameter regions)
- REINFORCE policy gradient variance
- Complex multi-objective optimization

### Failed Approaches

Two architectural experiments failed completely:

1. **Separated Gradient Inputs** (0% success): Giving the network 4 inputs [food_grad, pred_grad] instead of 2 combined inputs made learning harder, not easier. The environment's pre-computed combined gradient is a feature, not a bug.

2. **Dual-Stream Architecture** (0% success): Separate appetitive/aversive streams with gating failed even with fixed (perfect) gating. The fundamental issue is that isolated streams can't make coordinated decisions—each sees only partial context.

See [Appendix: Failed Approaches](supporting/003/experiment-details.md#failed-approaches-detailed-analysis) for full analysis.

### Learning Dynamics

Successful sessions show three phases:

1. **Exploration (episodes 1-25)**: High LR, high entropy, 40-50% success
2. **Refinement (episodes 25-50)**: Decaying LR/entropy, 60-70% success
3. **Exploitation (episodes 50-100)**: Low LR, low entropy, 70-90% success

Step efficiency improves dramatically: 227 steps early → 87 steps late (61% improvement).

## Conclusions

### Key Findings

01. **Spiking brains are viable**: 100% on static/foraging, 63% on predators
02. **Gradient explosion was the blocker**: Proper clipping (value + norm) essential
03. **Decay schedules critical**: LR and entropy decay enable convergence without regression
04. **Kaiming initialization reduces variance**: 60-point spread → 10-point spread with proper tuning
05. **Temporal integration is powerful**: 100 timesteps better than 50
06. **Online learning succeeds**: Unlike quantum, spiking learns during execution
07. **Slower LR decay was key for predators**: 0.01 → 0.005 unlocked 63% success
08. **Combined gradient is a feature**: Environment's pre-integration helps the network
09. **Dual-stream architecture failed**: Isolated streams can't coordinate decisions
10. **Intra-episode updates essential**: Episode-end updates too sparse for complex tasks

### Lessons Learned

1. **Gradient explosion is subtle**: Norm clipping alone insufficient, need value clipping first
2. **Decay schedules matter more than fixed hyperparams**: Exploration→exploitation transition is critical
3. **Biological realism compatible with deep learning**: Surrogate gradients bridge the gap
4. **Temporal integration is powerful**: 100 timesteps capture rich dynamics
5. **Variance is the enemy**: Initialization matters enormously
6. **Best session matters**: 100% post-convergence shows the ceiling is high
7. **Intra-episode updates are critical for dynamic tasks**: Episode-end updates too sparse
8. **Network size affects optimal learning rate**: 10x lower LR for 30x more parameters
9. **Action probability floors have narrow sweet spots**: Too high = gradient death; too low = collapse

### Performance vs Biological Plausibility

Our implementation achieves ~40% biological plausibility:

| Aspect | Plausibility | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Spike generation | High | Binary threshold like real neurons |
| Membrane dynamics | Moderate | LIF captures essential dynamics |
| Population coding | High | Gaussian tuning mirrors biology |
| Learning rule | Low | Surrogate gradients, not STDP |
| Connectivity | Low | Fully connected, not sparse |

The surrogate gradient approach trades biological realism for task performance. True STDP would be deployable on neuromorphic hardware but achieves worse results.

## Next Steps
