"""
Sensory feature extraction modules for brain architectures.

This module provides a unified interface for extracting sensory features from
BrainParams, supporting both quantum (ModularBrain) and classical (PPOBrain)
brain architectures through a single SensoryModule abstraction.

Architecture:
    Each sensory module encapsulates:

    1. **Core extraction**: BrainParams -> CoreFeatures (architecture-agnostic)
       - strength: [0, 1] where 0 = no signal, 1 = max signal
       - angle: [-1, 1] where 0 = aligned with agent heading
       - binary: 0 or 1 for on/off signals

    2. **Architecture transforms**:
       - to_quantum(): Returns np.ndarray [rx, ry, rz] in [-π/2, π/2]
       - to_classical(): Returns np.ndarray [strength, angle] preserving semantics

Module naming follows C. elegans neuroscience conventions:
- chemotaxis: Combined gradient sensing (ASE neurons)
- food_chemotaxis: Food-specific approach behavior (AWC, AWA neurons)
- nociception: Aversive/escape response (ASH, ADL neurons)
- thermotaxis: Temperature sensing (AFD neurons) - placeholder
- aerotaxis: Oxygen sensing (URX, BAG neurons) - placeholder
- mechanosensation: Touch/contact detection (ALM, PLM, AVM neurons)
- proprioception: Body orientation sensing

    This module uses SEPARATED food gradients (food_gradient_*) rather than

    Biological Reference:
        AWC neurons detect volatile attractants (benzaldehyde, isoamyl alcohol).
        AWA neurons detect additional attractants (diacetyl, pyrazine).
        Both project to interneurons that modulate turning behavior.

    The brain should learn: high strength + angle near 0 = danger ahead, turn away!

    Note on Gradient Direction:
        The predator gradient points TOWARD predators (danger direction), not away.
        This gives consistent semantics with food_chemotaxis where angle=0 means
        the signal source is directly ahead. The brain must learn that for
        nociception, moving AWAY from the angle direction is beneficial.

    Biological Reference:
        ASH neurons are polymodal nociceptors responding to nose touch, high
        osmolarity, and volatile repellents. ADL neurons respond to octanol
        and other repellents. Both trigger avoidance reflexes via interneurons.

    Unlike gradient-based modules, mechanosensation provides binary touch signals

    - angle: facing direction encoded as normalized angle [-1, 1]

    Movement detection:

    - FORWARD, LEFT, RIGHT, FORWARD_LEFT, FORWARD_RIGHT all indicate movement

    This provides the brain with awareness of its current heading and whether
    it is actively moving, enabling it to maintain consistent navigation
    strategies regardless of absolute grid orientation.

    Note on Acceleration:
        True acceleration sensing (velocity change over time) is not currently
        possible as the agent has constant speed. When variable speed or
        momentum is implemented, a separate vestibular/kinesthesia module
        could track acceleration.

    Biological Reference:
        DVA is a stretch-sensitive interneuron that modulates locomotion based

        body bending and curvature. Together they enable coordinated movement.

    """Extract features for classical neural networks with semantic-preserving ranges.

    Unlike quantum features which use rotation gate angles, classical features
    preserve semantic meaning, making them easier for neural networks to learn:

    - strength: [0, 1] where 0 = no signal, 1 = strong signal
    - angle: [-1, 1] where 0 = aligned with agent heading
    - binary (for modules with classical_dim=3): [-1, 1] module-specific scalar

    Parameters
    ----------
    params : BrainParams
        Agent state containing sensory information from the environment.
    modules : list[ModuleName]
        List of modules to extract features for.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray

        while some (like thermotaxis) contribute 3 values [strength, angle, binary].
        Shape: (sum of classical_dim for all modules,)

    --------
