    Detect when learning strategy converges using adaptive algorithm.

    Convergence is detected when the success rate variance falls below a threshold
    for a sustained number of runs AND the mean success rate in that window is
    above a minimum threshold, indicating the strategy has learned and stabilized.

    The algorithm searches from the beginning to find the earliest point where
    a stable, successful window begins. This allows detecting early convergence
    (e.g., at run 4) while still requiring enough total data for reliable detection.

    Parameters
    ----------
    results : list[SimulationResult]
        Ordered list of simulation results from a session.
    variance_threshold : float, optional
        Maximum variance to consider converged (default: 0.05 = 5%).
    stability_runs : int, optional
        Number of consecutive low-variance runs required (default: 10).
    min_total_runs : int, optional
        Minimum total runs required before convergence detection is attempted
        (default: 30). This ensures we have enough data to distinguish true
        convergence from temporary plateaus.
    min_success_rate : float, optional
        Minimum mean success rate required in the stability window for
        convergence to be declared (default: 0.5 = 50%). This prevents
        detecting "convergence" when the agent is stably failing.

    Returns
    -------
    int | None
        1-indexed run number where the stable region begins,
        or None if never converged.

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm checks if success rate variance in a sliding window of
    `stability_runs` remains below the threshold AND the mean success rate
    is above the minimum. It searches from the start to find the earliest
    convergence point.

    For example, if an agent achieves 100% success from run 5 onward with a
    stability window of 10, convergence will be reported at run 5 (since the
    window from run 5-14 is stable and successful). Returns 1-indexed values
    so run 5 means the 5th run.

    Calculate weighted composite benchmark score with multi-objective support.

    The composite score uses hierarchical weighting where survival acts as a gate:
    - If agent died (survival_score provided but low): score is capped
    - Secondary objectives (temperature comfort) only count if agent survives

    For single-objective tasks (no survival/thermotaxis), uses the original formula:
    - Success rate (40%): How often the strategy succeeds
    - Distance efficiency (30%): How efficiently it navigates
    - Learning speed (20%): How quickly it converges
    - Stability (10%): How consistent it is after convergence

    For multi-objective tasks, the formula adapts:
    - If died (survival_score < 0.1): composite capped at 0.3 * primary_completion
    - If survived: weights redistribute to include secondary objectives
